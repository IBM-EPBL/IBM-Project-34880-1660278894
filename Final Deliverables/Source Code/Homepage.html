            Due to the ignorance of healthy food habits, obesity rates are increasing at an alarming speed, and this is
            reflective of the risks to people’s health.
            People need to control their daily calorie intake by eating healthier foods, which is the most basic method
            to avoid obesity
            However, although food packaging comes with nutrition (and calorie) labels, it's still not very convenient
            for people to refer to App-based nutrient dashboard systems which can analyze real-time images of a meal and
            analyze it for nutritional content which can be very handy and improves the dietary habits, and therefore,
            helps in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
